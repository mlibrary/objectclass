Developing a migration plan from DLXS
https://tools.lib.umich.edu/confluence/display/OBC/ObjectClass+Home?src=sidebar

The idea: migrate data from DLXS into **haversacks**, review the haversacks for 
completeness, and then generate **bags** from the haversacks to create a 
preservation object that can be migrated into _something_.

At this point we're making some assumptions, including symlinking to actual files.
